# 13. Roman to Integer

### Problem

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```

For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 15`
- `s` contains only the characters `('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M')`.
- It is **guaranteed** that `s` is a valid roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`.

### My Code

```python
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        RtoI = {
            "I": 1,
            "V": 5,
            "X": 10,
            "L": 50,
            "C": 100,
            "D": 500,
            "M": 1000,
        }
        
        result = 0
        
        s = s.replace("IV", "IIII").replace("IX", "VIIII")
        s = s.replace("XL", "XXXX").replace("XC", "LXXXX")
        s = s.replace("CD", "CCCC").replace("CM", "DCCCC")
        
        for n in s:
            result += RtoI[n]
            
        return result
```

### Takeaway

```markdown
너무 손을 안대서 그런지 어떻게 접근해야 할 지 바로 연상이 되질 않았다. 주기적으로 공부를 해야 할 필요성을 느꼈다.

시간복잡도를 조금 더 생각하면서 문제를 풀어봐야 할 것 같다.
